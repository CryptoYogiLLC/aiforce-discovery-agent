  This is the AIForce Discovery Agent project - a microservices-based system for
  application discovery in client environments. Key things to know:

  1. POLYGLOT: Go (network-scanner), Python (analyzers, processing), TypeScript (UI)
  2. EVENT-DRIVEN: Services communicate via CloudEvents through RabbitMQ
  3. CRITICAL LESSONS: Read .serena/memories/ for patterns from the parent project
  4. NEVER create band-aid solutions - always fix root causes

  Before making changes, check relevant memories for patterns and anti-patterns.
